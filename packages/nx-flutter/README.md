## Features

Here is a list of some of the coolest features of the plugin:

- ‚úÖ Generation of Flutter applications/packages/modules/plugins based on **Flutter cli** API
- ‚úÖ Building, packaging, testing, etc your Flutter projects
- ‚úÖ Integration with Nx's **dependency graph** (through `nx dep-graph` or `nx affected:dep-graph`): this allows you to **visualize** the dependencies of any Flutter projects inside your workspace, just like Nx natively does it for JS/TS-based projects!

## Setup

<details open>
<summary>üì¢ ‚ÑπÔ∏è üÜï <b>HEADS UP!</b> New <b>simplified</b> setup since <i>October 2023</i>, with our custom <b>CLI</b>!</summary>


> You can now use our own `create-nx-flutter` **CLI** to easily create a Nx workspace, that comes with this plugin pre-installed!
> 
> Simply run:
> 
> ```
> # npm
> npx create-nx-flutter@latest
> # or
> # yarn
> yarn create nx-flutter
> ```
> 
> and you are good to go‚Äßo‚Äßo‚Äßo! üöÄ

</details>


Otherwise, this is the traditional way of setting things up:

### 1. Creating the Nx workspace

This plugin relies on [`flutter's command-line`](https://flutter.dev/docs/reference/flutter-cli) to do its job. So, you must have [`flutter`](https://flutter.dev) installed on your system. If not, head to [flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and follow installation instructions for your OS.

Then, if you have not already, [create an Nx workspace](https://github.com/nrwl/nx#creating-an-nx-workspace) with the following:

```
# npm
npx create-nx-workspace@latest

# yarn
yarn create nx-workspace@latest
```

### 2. Installing the Plugin

Then you need to install the plugin in order to generate Flutter applications later on.

```
# npm
npm install @nxrocks/nx-flutter --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add @nxrocks/nx-flutter --dev
```

## Generators

This plugin is composed of 1 main **generator**:

- `project` generator

### Generating Projects (`project` generator)

Simply run the `project` generator with the following command:

```
nx g @nxrocks/nx-flutter:project <app-folder>
```


> you can also use the following aliases to call the generator: `prj`, `new`, `gen`, `init`, `create`, or `generate`

You will be prompted for entering the most commonly customized generation options (like application's `package`, `description`, `template`,  etc).

To skip the interactive prompt, or if you want to customize all non-prompted options, you can pass them along directly when running the command, as such:

```
nx g @nxrocks/nx-flutter:project <app-folder> --optionName1 optionValue1 ... --optionNameN optionValueN
```

#### Generation Options

Here the list of available generation options :

| Arguments | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| `<output-folder>`  | The folder that will contain your app |

Option           | Value | Description
---------------- | ----- | ------------
`org`            | `string` | Name of the package
`description`    | `string` | Description of the project
`androidLanguage`| `java` \| `kotlin`  | Language to use for Android code
`iOSLanguage`    | `objc` \| `swift` |  Language to use for iOS code
`template`       | `app` \| `module` \| `package` \| `plugin` | Template of Flutter project to generate
`sample`         | `string` | Sample ID of the desired sample from the API documentation website (http://docs.flutter.dev)
`platforms`      | `android` \| `ios` \| `linux` \| `macos` \| `windows` \| `web`  | Platforms supported by the project to generate
`pub`            | `boolean` | Whether to run "flutter pub get" after the project has been created
`offline`        | `boolean` | Whether or not to run 'flutter pub get' in offline mode
`tags`           | `string` | Tags to use for linting (comma-separated)
`directory`      | `string` | Directory where the project is placed

## Executors

Once your app is generated, you can now use **executors** to manage it.

Here the list of available executors<sup>1</sup>:

| Executor        | Arguments        | Description                                |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |

<sup>1</sup> : *Actual executors in your `workspace.json` will depend on the type of `flutter` project (`template`), target `platforms` that you choose to generate.*

Each executor is based on an original project-level `flutter` command. The name is just **kebab-cased** to match executors' naming conventions.
Besides, the arguments accepted by each executor, are the same as the original `flutter` command they are based upon, encapsulated
under a generic `--args='...'` option.

For example:

```
$ flutter gen-l10n --header "/// my header"

becomes üëâüèæ

$ nx gen-l10n your-flutterapp --args='--header="/// my header"'
```

> Note that the original `flutter` command name (`gen-l10n`) has been camelcased for creating its `nx-flutter` equivalent (`gen-l10n`)

> Note that the arguments of the original `flutter` command are wrapped under `--args='...'` option in  the `nx-flutter` equivalent
