> Our very own **CLI** to create [Nx](https://nx.dev) workspaces with built-in support for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)!

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinesoft/nxrocks/master/images/create-nx-flutter.png" width="680"></p>

The goal of this CLI is to ease the process of creating a Nx workspace that can host and manage Flutter projects, thanks to our [@nxrocks/nx-flutter](https://github.com/tinesoft/nxrocks/blob/develop/packages/nx-flutter) plugin, that is automatically installed within it.

##  Prerequisites

To run this CLI, all you need is to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed (preferably the current LTS version).
Then to later create and run your Flutter projets, you'll need [Flutter CLI](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) as well.

- **NodeJS** (preferably latest or LTS version) in path
- **Flutter CLI** in path

## Getting Started

Run `npx create-nx-flutter your-workspace-name` to execute the CLI.

This command will guide you through the creation process steps by steps.

## Options

Run `npx create-nx-flutter --help` to print some helpful info on available options.
